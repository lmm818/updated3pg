          <h2 class="sectionHeader">How are these centers privatized?</h2>
          <p>The private prison industry got its start in the 1980s after public prisons became overcrowded and a need for more prisons arised.
            Immigration at one point became such a crisis in the United States that centers began to pop up to help detain immigrants.
            These centers get money every day based on how many detainees they house and feed, so there is incentive to keeping them in there for longer for almost no reason at all.</p>

          <p>Centers such as the one in this video operate much like a prison. There is more liberty in the things that can be done in a place like this one since it is privatized.
          Practices such as only 2 hours of recreation time as well as no internet available for the detainees is cruel. It can break down one's spirit being completely in the dark
          about what could happen with their situation.</p>

          <p>Last year, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill to phase out use of private prison companies by 2028. New or renewed contracts with these private facilities have not been allowed since January 1st, 2020.
          This is a huge step in the right direction, but this is not the case for the entire country.</p>
