          <h2 class="sectionHeader">What are detention centers?</h2>
          <p>Daily, immigrants detained by ICE or CBP (Customs and Border Protection) are held in detention centers throughout the country. They are typically held on the grounds of waiting for updates to their legal status in the United States. This usually results in two things: a court date for determination of their immigration status or deportation. </p>
          <h2 class="sectionHeader">Who is ICE? What do they do?</h2>
          <p>ICE, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is an agency created within the Department of Homeland Security as a countermeasure to the September 11, 2001 attacks. Since then, it has grown to become a huge part of how our country deals with immigrants. There are three departments to ICE: enforcement and removal operations, homeland security investigations, and the office of the principal legal advisor. </p>
